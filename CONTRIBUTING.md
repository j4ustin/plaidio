# Contributing

1.  Make one or more atomic commits, and ensure that each commit has a
    descriptive commit message. Commit messages should be line wrapped
    at 72 characters.

2.  Make sure that there are tests for the code you wrote.

3.  Make sure that you've documented all public methods using [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org/).

4.  Run `rake test`, and address any errors. Preferably, fix commits
    in place using `git rebase` or `git commit --amend` to make the
    changes easier to review.

5.  Open a pull request.
